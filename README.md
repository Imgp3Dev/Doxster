in order to use Doxster to it's fullest extent make sure to go to src/Doxster.cpp and add a specific path to your images within the system() code.

Now there are a few other things to keep in mind.
if you want to search for names within social media then use SocialWebsites.txt, read the Doxster.cpp comments. basically depending on what you want to do you need to enter a certain file.

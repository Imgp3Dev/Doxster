## Configuration
in order to use Doxster to it's fullest extent make sure to go to **src/Doxster.cpp** and add a specific path to your images within the **system()** code.

Now there are a few other things to keep in mind.
if you want to search for names within **social media then use socialwebsites.txt, For Phone number Revers searching use ReverseNumber.txt, etc**


Note: Doxster isn't finished and still has some issues.
